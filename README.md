Car Price Prediction

Algorithms Used:

The car price prediction system employs a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures to analyse transaction data and identify price patterns effectively. The following algorithms are utilized in the project:

•	Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification, logistic regression is employed to model the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on its features.

•	Decision Trees: Decision tree-based algorithms, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, are utilized to capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions between features in the transaction data.

•	Neural Networks: Deep learning architectures, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to learn hierarchical representations of transaction data and extract discriminative features for fraud detection.
